window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Exclusively from Audible </b></p> <p><i>Emma</i> can be enjoyed as a charming love story, a detective story, and a comic and lively picture of English life 200 years ago. </p> <p>Austen's beautiful, clever, wilful but fallible heroine Emma Woodhouse believes she knows best. Perfectly content with her life she sees no need for either love or marriage, yet nothing pleases her more than meddling in the romantic lives of others. But when she fails to heed the warnings of her good friend Mr. Knightley and schemes to arrange a suitable match for her protégée, Harriet Smith, her carefully laid plans soon unravel and have consequences that she never expected. She discovers that she understands the feelings of others as little as she does her own heart. </p> <p>With a cast of unforgettable characters, it is a lively comedy of manners that explores the concerns of genteel women living in Regency times. </p> <p>Jane Austen was an English writer known primarily for her six major novels which focused on the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Her plots often explore women's dependence on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. </p> <p><i>Narrator Biography</i></p> <p>Jenny Agutter began her acting career as a child in 1964's <i>East of Sudan</i> and is well known for appearing in three adaptations of <i>The Railway Children</i>.
