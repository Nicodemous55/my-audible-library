That’s why Frankie's not prepared for the day that he arrives for his weekend visit with a new woman on his arm and out-of-state train tickets in his pocket.</p> <p>Now, Frankie and her sister, Toni, are abandoned alongside so many other orphans - two young, unwanted women doing everything they can to survive.</p> <p>And as the embers of the Great Depression are kindled&nbsp;into the fires of World War II, and the shadows of injustice, poverty, and death walk the streets in broad daylight, it will be up to Frankie to find something&nbsp;worth holding on to in the&nbsp;ruins of&nbsp;this shattered America - every minute of every day spent wondering if the life&nbsp;she's able to carve out will be enough.</p> <p><b><i>I will admit I do not know the answer. But I will be watching, waiting to find out.</i></b></p> <p><b><i>That’s what ghosts do.</i></b></p>";
