window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first volume of the Arthurian fantasy series, The Perilous Order of Camelot, <i>The Dragon and the Unicorn</i> answers the mythic question, \"Who were King Arthur's parents?\" Legend says mortal enemies: the British warlord Uther Pendragon and Ygrane queen of the Celts. Merlin brought them together. But who <i>is</i> Merlin? And how did his magic unite such ill-starred lovers to bring forth the world's most legendary king? </p> <p>The demon Lailoken, as old as time, is tricked by angelic powers, the Fire Lords, and trapped in a human body. He becomes Merlinus, a wandering wise man expert in magic, destined to work for good among humans, opposed by the Furor, Odin. An encounter with the unicorn - a spirit similarly earthbound - brings him to Ygrane, queen of the Celts, and she sets him a task to find her king, a man seen in vision and fated to be her love-match. Merlinus-Lailoken seeks and finds him: Theodosius, a stable worker. But Ygrane has commanded the demon-wizard to bring her a king, so Merlinus sets to work making one. </p>";
