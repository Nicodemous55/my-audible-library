window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A globetrotting voyage of discovery celebrating the navigational superpowers of animals - by land, sea, and sky </b></p> <p>Animals plainly know where they're going, but how they get there has remained surprisingly mysterious - until now.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Supernavigators</i>, award-winning author David Barrie catches us up on the cutting-edge science. Here are astounding animals of every stripe: Dung beetles that steer by the light of the Milky Way. Ants and bees that rely on patterns of light invisible to humans. Sea turtles and moths that find their way using Earth's magnetic field. Humpback whales that swim thousands of miles while holding a rock-steady course. Birds that can locate their nests on a tiny island after crisscrossing an ocean.&nbsp;</p> <p>The age of viewing animals as unthinking drones is over. As <i>Supernavigators </i>makes clear, a stunning array of species command senses, skills - and arguably, types of intelligence - beyond our own. Weaving together interviews with leading animal behaviorists and the groundbreaking discoveries of Nobel Prize-winning scientists, David Barrie reveals these wonders in a whole new light.</p>";
