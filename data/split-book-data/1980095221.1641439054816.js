But this summer is different. One morning, Morgan finds a dead body. It's their former classmate and coworker Ethan. To make matters worse, Morgan is taken to a hospital psych ward only days later, and she's not saying much - not even to Ivy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The police claim that Ethan simply took a bad fall, but Ivy isn't convinced and realizes it's up to her to get answers.&nbsp;</p> <p>What she finds is unsettling - it's clear that some people aren't being honest about Ethan's last night at Fabuland. Including Morgan. And the more secrets Ivy uncovers, the closer she gets to unraveling dark truths that will change her life forever.</p>";
