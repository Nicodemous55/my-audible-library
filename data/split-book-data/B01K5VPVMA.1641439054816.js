window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The number one <i>New York Times</i> best seller and National Book Award Finalist from the best-selling author of <i>Everything</i> <i>Everything</i> will have you falling in love with Natasha and Daniel as they fall in love with each other.</p> <p><b>Natasha:</b> I’m a girl who believes in science and facts. Not fate. Not destiny. Or dreams that will never come true. I’m definitely not the kind of girl who meets a cute boy on a crowded New York City street and falls in love with him. Not when my family is 12 hours away from being deported to Jamaica. Falling in love with him won’t be my story.</p> <p><b>Daniel:</b> I’ve always been the good son, the good student, living up to my parents’ high expectations. Never the poet. Or the dreamer. But when I see her, I forget about all that. Something about Natasha makes me think that fate has something much more extraordinary in store - for both of us.</p> <p><b>The Universe:</b> Every moment in our lives has brought us to this single moment. A million futures lie before us. Which one will come true?</p>";
