Here is their story, told for the first time in the words of the band. Adam \"ADROCK\" Horovitz and Michael \"Mike D\" Diamond offer revealing and very funny accounts of their transition from teenage punks to budding rappers; their early collaboration with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin; the debut album that became the first hip hop record ever to hit number one, <i>Licensed to Ill</i> - and the album's messy fallout as the band broke with Def Jam; their move to Los Angeles and rebirth with the genre-defying masterpiece <i>Paul's Boutique</i>; their evolution as musicians and social activists over the course of the classic albums <i>Check Your Head</i>, <i>Ill Communication</i>, and <i>Hello Nasty</i> and the Tibetan Freedom Concert benefits conceived by the late Adam \"MCA\" Yauch; and more. For more than 30 years, this band has had an inescapable and indelible influence on popular culture.&nbsp;</p> <p>With a style as distinctive and eclectic as a Beastie Boys album, <i>Beastie Boys Book</i> upends the typical music memoir, featuring a collection of voices reminiscent of your favorite mixtape.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Photo Credit © 1987 Lynn Goldsmith </i></p> <p><b>Audiobook Cast Includes:</b><br> </p> <p>Steve Buscemi / Ada Calhoun / Bobby Cannavale / Exene Cervenka Roy Choi / Jarvis Cocker / Elvis Costello / Chuck D / Nadia Dajani Michael Diamond / Snoop Dogg / Will Ferrell / Crosby Fitzgerald Randy Gardner / Kim Gordon / Josh Hamilton / Adam Horovitz LL Cool J / Spike Jonze / Pat Kiernan / Talib Kweli / Dave Macklovitch Rachel Maddow / Tim Meadows / Bette Midler/ Mix Master Mike Nas / Yoshimi O / Rosie Perez / Amy Poehler / Kelly Reichardt John C.

As with [the band’s] records, the book's structure is a lyrical three-man weave.... Diamond's voice is lapidary, droll. Horovitz comes on like a borscht belt comedian, but beneath that he is urgent, incredulous, kind of vulnerable.... Friendship is the book's subject as much as music, fame and New York.\" (</b><b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>\"Wild, moving...resembles a Beastie Boys LP in its wild variety of styles.\" (</b><b><i>Rolling Stone</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
