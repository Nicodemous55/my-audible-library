window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Leah on the Offbeat</i></b><b> meets </b><b><i>We Are Okay</i></b><b> in this pitch-perfect queer romance about falling in love and never quite falling out of it - heartbreak, unexpected new crushes, and all.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Before Quinn Ryan was <i>in</i> love with Jamie Rudawski, she loved Jamie Rudawski, who was her best friend. But when Jamie dumps Quinn a month before their senior year, Quinn is suddenly girlfriend-less and best friend-less.&nbsp;</p> <p>Enter a new crush: Ruby Ocampo, the gorgeous and rich lead singer of the popular band Sweets, who's just broken up with her on-again, off-again boyfriend. Quinn's always only wanted to be with Jamie, but if Jamie no longer wants to be with her, why can't Quinn go all in on Ruby? But the closer Quinn grows to Ruby, the more she misses Jamie, and the more (she thinks) Jamie misses her. Who says your first love can't be your second love, too?&nbsp;</p> <p>Katie Heaney is a full-time senior writer for <i>The Cut,</i> a former editor at <i>BuzzFeed,</i> and the author of the memoirs <i>Never Have I Ever: My Life (So Far) Without a Date</i> and <i>Would You Rather?
