window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A Stonewall Honor Book * A </b><b><i>Time </i></b><b>Magazine Best YA Book of All Time</b></p> <p><b>From Stonewall and Lambda Award-winning author Kacen Callender comes a revelatory YA novel about a transgender teen grappling with identity and self-discovery while falling in love for the first time.</b></p> <p>Felix Love has never been <i>in </i>love — and, yes, he’s painfully aware of the irony. He desperately wants to know what it’s like and why it seems so easy for everyone but him&nbsp;to find someone. What’s worse is that, even though he is proud of his identity, Felix also secretly fears that he’s one marginalization too many — Black, queer, and transgender — to ever get his own happily-ever-after.</p> <p>When an anonymous student begins sending him transphobic messages — after publicly posting Felix’s deadname alongside images of him before he transitioned — Felix comes up with a plan for revenge. What he didn’t count on: his catfish scenario landing him in a quasi-love triangle....</p> <p>But as he navigates his complicated feelings, Felix begins a journey of questioning and self-discovery that helps redefine his most important relationship: how he feels about himself.</p> <p><i>Felix Ever After</i> is an honest and layered story about identity, falling in love, and recognizing the love you deserve.</p> <p><b>\"Felix is attending an ultracompetitive arts summer program to have a better shot at a full scholarship to Brown when someone posts Felix’s dead name beside photos of him, pre-transition, in the school’s lobby. Felix’s plot to get revenge throws him onto the path of love and self-discovery.\"&nbsp;(</b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><b>, \"An Anti-Racist Children's and YA Reading List\")</b></p>";
