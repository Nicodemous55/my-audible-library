window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>City of Fallen Angels </i>take up where <i>City of Glass </i>left off. With Valentine out of the way, Clary thought she and Jace could finally be together--but when someone starts murdering the Shadowhunters who used to be in Valentine's Circle and leaving their bodies around New York City in a manner designed to destroy the new peace between Downworlders and Shadowhunters, she realizes the past can never be left entirely behind. As the Shadowhunters scramble to find out what's really going on, Jace breaks off all communication with her, refusing to tell her why. Desperate to help him, Clary plunges into solving the mystery, coming ever closer to a secret whose revelation may mend her relationship with Jace--or rip it apart forever. Meanwhile, when Camille Belcourt, the elegant bloodsucker who used to rule New York's vampire clans with an iron fist, returns to the city determined to re-establish her control, a vampire war is born. Only Simon--the Daylighter who everyone wants on their side--can decide the outcome; too bad he's caught up in his own complicated love life and wants nothing to do with Downworld politics! Love, blood, betrayal and revenge: the stakes are higher than ever in <i>City of Fallen Angels</i>.";
