window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, here is the universally acclaimed novel - winner of the Booker Prize and the basis for an award-winning film.</b></p> <p>This is Kazuo Ishiguro's profoundly compelling portrait of Stevens, the perfect butler, and of his fading, insular world in post-World War II England. Stevens, at the end of three decades of service at Darlington Hall, spending a day on a country drive, embarks as well on a journey through the past in an effort to reassure himself that he has served humanity by serving the \"great gentleman\", Lord Darlington. But lurking in his memory are doubts about the true nature of Lord Darlington's \"greatness\", and much graver doubts about the nature of his own life.</p>";
