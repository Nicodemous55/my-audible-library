The problem is, she’s never been in love - she’ll have to find the perfect guy before she can kill him.</b></p> <p>After years of waiting for her Calling - a trial every witch must pass to come into their powers - the one thing Voya Thomas didn’t expect was to fail. When Voya’s ancestor gives her an unprecedented second chance to complete her Calling, she agrees - and then is horrified when her task is to kill her first love. And this time, failure means every Thomas witch will be stripped of their magic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Voya is determined to save her family’s magic no matter the cost. The problem is, Voya has never been in love, so for her to succeed, she’ll first have to find the perfect guy - and fast. Fortunately, a genetic matchmaking program has just hit the market. Her plan is to join the program, fall in love, and complete her task before the deadline. What she doesn’t count on is being paired with the infuriating Luc - how can she fall in love with a guy who seemingly wants nothing to do with her?&nbsp;</p> <p>With mounting pressure from her family, Voya is caught between her morality and her duty to her bloodline. If she wants to save their heritage <i>and</i> Luc, she’ll have to find something her ancestor wants more than blood. And in witchcraft, blood is everything.</p>";
