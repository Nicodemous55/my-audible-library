window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Apollo</i> is the behind-the-scenes story of an epic achievement. Based on exhaustive research that included many exclusive interviews, <i>Apollo</i> tells how America went from a standing start to a landing on the moon at a speed that now seems impossible. It describes the unprecedented engineering challenges that had to be overcome to create the mammoth<i> Saturn V</i> and the facilities to launch it. It takes you onto the gantries at Cape Canaveral and behind the consoles of Houston's Mission Control as it relives the tragedy of the fire on <i>Apollo 1</i>, the first descent to the lunar surface, and the rescue of <i>Apollo 13</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>A story of daring bordering on recklessness on the ground and life-and-death decisions made in seconds during the flights, <i>Apollo</i> captures the drama of humans leaving Earth for the first time.</p>";
