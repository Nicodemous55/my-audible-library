window.bookSummaryJSON = "This full-cast drama, part of BBC Audiobooks' Classic Radio Sci-Fi series, is based on the classic post-war 'science fantasy' novel which made John Wyndham famous, and whose appeal endures to this day. Giles Cooper's six-part adaptation stars Gary Watson, Barbara Shelley and Peter Sallis, with appearances from <i>Doctor Who</i> names Peter Pratt, Christopher Bidmead and David Brierley. Divided by blindness and societal breakdown, humanity is at the mercy of the carniverous Triffids.... <p>This BBC Radio 4 production was made and broadcast in 1968, and later transmitted via World Service. </p>";
