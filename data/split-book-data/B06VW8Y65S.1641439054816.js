And so perhaps it was inevitable that he would become a spy....&nbsp;</p> <p>Malcolm's parents run an inn called the Trout, on the banks of the river Thames, and all of Oxford passes through its doors. Malcolm and his daemon, Asta, routinely overhear news and gossip, and the occasional scandal, but during a winter of unceasing rain, Malcolm catches wind of something new: intrigue.&nbsp;</p> <p>He finds a secret message inquiring about a dangerous substance called Dust - and the spy it was intended for finds him.&nbsp;</p> <p>When she asks Malcolm to keep his eyes open, he sees suspicious characters everywhere: the explorer Lord Asriel, clearly on the run; enforcement agents from the Magisterium; a gyptian named Coram with warnings just for Malcolm; and a beautiful woman with an evil monkey for a daemon. All are asking about the same thing: a girl - just a baby - named Lyra.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lyra is the kind of person who draws people in like magnets. And Malcolm will brave any danger, and make shocking sacrifices, to bring her safely through the storm.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"The book is full of wonder.... Truly thrilling.\" (<i>The New York Times</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>Note: This audiobook was recorded from the UK edition.&nbsp;</p>";
