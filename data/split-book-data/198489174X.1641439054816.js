From the mind of Chuck Wendig comes \"a magnum opus...a story about survival that’s not just about you and me, but all of us, together\" (</b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><b> starred review).</b></p> <p><b>Nominated for the Bram Stoker Award</b></p> <p><b>Named one of the Best Books of the Year by:</b></p> <ul> <li><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><b> </b></li> <li><b>NPR </b></li> <li><b><i>The Dallas Morning News</i></b><b> </b></li> <li><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><b> </b></li> <li><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><b> </b></li> <li><b><i>Library Journal</i></b>&nbsp;</li> <li><b><i>Polygon </i></b></li> </ul> <p>Shana wakes up one morning to discover her little sister in the grip of a strange malady. She appears to be sleepwalking. She cannot talk and cannot be woken up. And she is heading with inexorable determination to a destination that only she knows. But Shana and her sister are not alone. Soon, they are joined by a flock of sleepwalkers from across America, on the same mysterious journey. And like Shana, there are other \"shepherds\" who follow the flock to protect their friends and family on the long dark road ahead.</p> <p>For as the sleepwalking phenomenon awakens terror and violence in America, the real danger may not be the epidemic but the fear of it. With society collapsing all around them - and an ultraviolent militia threatening to exterminate them - the fate of the sleepwalkers depends on unraveling the mystery behind the epidemic. The terrifying secret will either tear the nation apart - or bring the survivors together to remake a shattered world.</p> <p>In development for TV by Glen Mazzara, executive producer of&nbsp;<i>The Walking Dead</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>Look for the sequel in 2022&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>Wanderers</i></b></p> <p>\"This career-defining epic deserves its inevitable comparisons to Stephen King’s <i>The Stand</i>.\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> starred review)</p> <p>\"A suspenseful, twisty, satisfying, surprising, thought-provoking epic.\" (Harlan Coben, number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Run Away</i>)</p> <p>\"A true tour de force.\" (Erin Morgenstern, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Night Circus</i>)</p> <p>\"A masterpiece with prose as sharp and heartbreaking as <i>Station Eleven</i>.\" (Peng Shepherd, author of <i>The Book of M</i>)</p> <p>\"A magnum opus....
