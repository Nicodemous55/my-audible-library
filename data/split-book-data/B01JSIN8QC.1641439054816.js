They hope this sacrifice will keep her from terrorizing their town. But the witch in the forest, Xan, is kind and gentle. She shares her home with a wise Swamp Monster named Glerk and a Perfectly Tiny Dragon, Fyrian. Xan rescues the abandoned children and delivers them to welcoming families on the other side of the forest, nourishing the babies with starlight on the journey. </p> <p>One year Xan accidentally feeds a baby moonlight instead of starlight, filling the ordinary child with extraordinary magic.

Meanwhile, a young man from the Protectorate is determined to free his people by killing the witch. Soon it is up to Luna to protect those who have protected her - even if it means the end of the loving, safe world she's always known. </p> <p>The acclaimed author of <i>The Witch's Boy</i> has created another epic coming-of-age fairy tale destined to become a modern classic. </p>";
