The events of <i>City of Heavenly Fire </i>left him stripped of his memories, and Simon isn't sure who he is anymore. So when the Shadowhunter Academy reopens, Simon throws himself into this new world of demon hunting, determined to find himself again. Whomever this new Simon might be. </p> <p>But the Academy is a Shadowhunter institution, which means it has some problems. Like the fact that non-Shadowhunter students have to live in the basement. At least Simon's trained in weaponry - even if it's only from hours of playing D&amp;D. </p> <p>Join Simon on his journey to become a Shadowhunter, and learn about the Academy's illustrious history along the way through guest lecturers such as Jace Herondale, Tessa Gray, and Magnus Bane. Written by Cassandra Clare, Sarah Rees Brennan, Maureen Johnson, and Robin Wasserman, these moving and hilarious short stories are perfect for the fan who just can't get enough of the Shadowhunters. </p> <p>Full cast of narrators includes Torrance Coombs, Sam Heughan, Keahu Kahuanui, and Brett Dalton. </p>";
