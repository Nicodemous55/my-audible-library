Hardening her heart, the young woman sets out to claim what is owed and soon gains a reputation for being able to turn silver into gold. When an ill-advised boast draws the attention of the king of the Staryk - grim fey creatures who seem more ice than flesh - Miryem’s fate, and that of two kingdoms, will be forever altered.&nbsp;</p> <p>She will face an impossible challenge and, along with two unlikely allies, uncover a secret that threatens to consume the lands of humans and Staryk alike.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Praise for Spinning Silver:</b></p> <p>'“A perfect tale.... A big and meaty novel, rich in both ideas and people,&nbsp;with the vastness of Tolkien and the empathy and joy in daily life of Le Guin.” (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)</p> <p>“Gorgeous, complex, and magical.... This is the kind of book that one might wish to inhabit forever.” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)</p> <p>“Cool and clever and . . . dire and wonderful.” (Laini Taylor, author of&nbsp;<i>Strange the Dreamer</i>)</p> <p>“The Rumpelstiltskin fairy tale has never been as captivating.... <i>Spinning Silver</i>&nbsp;further cements [Novik’s] place as one of the genre greats.” (<i>Paste</i>)&nbsp;</p>";
