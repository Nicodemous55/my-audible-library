window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Bloomsbury presents </b><b><i>The Bone Season: A Novel</i></b><b> by Samantha Shannon, read by Alana Kerr Collins.</b></p> <p><b>The </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling first novel in the Bone Season series, an epic fantasy about a young woman fighting to use her powers and stay alive in an England entirely different from our own.</b></p> <p>In 2059, Scion has taken over most of the world's cities, promising safety for all the citizens it deems worthy and wiping out clairvoyants wherever it can find them.</p> <p>Paige Mahoney, though, is a clairvoyant - and a criminal just for existing. Paige is determined to fight Scion's power, and as part of the Seven Seals, Paige has found a use for her powers: She scouts for information by breaking into others' minds as they dream.</p> <p>But when Paige is captured and arrested, she encounters a power more sinister even than Scion. The Voyant prison is a separate city, controlled by a powerful, otherworldly race. These creatures, the Rephaim, value the Voyants highly - as soldiers in their army.</p> <p>Paige is assigned to a Rephaite keeper, Warden, who will be in charge of her care and training. He is her master. Her natural enemy. But if she wants to regain her freedom, Paige will have to learn something of his mind and his own mysterious motives.</p> <p><i>The Bone Season </i>introduces a compelling heroine - a young woman learning to harness her powers in a world where everything has been taken from her. It also introduces an extraordinary young writer, with huge ambition and a teeming imagination. Samantha Shannon has created a bold new reality in this riveting debut.</p>";
