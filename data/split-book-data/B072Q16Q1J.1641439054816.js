window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The classic novel of fly fishing and spirituality republished with a new afterword by the author.</b> </p> <p>Since its publication in 1983, <i>The River Why</i> has become a classic. David James Duncan's sweeping novel is a coming-of-age comedy about love, nature, and the quest for self-discovery, written in a voice as distinct and powerful as any in American letters. </p> <p>Gus Orviston is a young fly fisherman who leaves behind his comically schizoid family to find his own path. Taking refuge in a remote cabin, he sets out in pursuit of the Pacific Northwest's elusive steelhead. But what begins as a physical quarry becomes a spiritual one as his quest for self-knowledge batters him with unforeseeable experiences. </p> <p>Profoundly reflective about our connection to nature and to one another, <i>The River Why</i> is also a comedic roller coaster. Like Gus, the listener emerges utterly changed, stripped bare by the journey Duncan so expertly navigates. </p>";
