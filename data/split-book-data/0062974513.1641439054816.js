window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of </b><b><i>The Disasters</i></b><b>, this genre-bending YA fantasy heist story is perfect for fans of Marie Lu and Amie Kaufman.</b></p> <p>In Kyrkarta, magic - known as maz - was once a freely available natural resource. Then, an earthquake released a magical plague, killing thousands and opening the door for a greedy corporation to make maz a commodity that’s tightly controlled - and, of course, outrageously expensive.</p> <p>Which is why Diz and her three best friends run a highly lucrative, <i>highly</i> illegal maz siphoning gig on the side. Their next job is supposed to be their last heist ever.</p> <p>But when their plan turns up a powerful new strain of maz that (literally) blows up in their faces, they’re driven to unravel a conspiracy at the very center of the spellplague - and possibly save the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>No pressure.</p>";
