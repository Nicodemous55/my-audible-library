window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of </b><b><i>Hot Dog Girl</i></b><b> comes a fresh and funny queer YA contemporary novel about two teens who fall in love in an indie comic book shop. </b></p> <p>Jubilee has it all together. She's an elite cellist, and when she's not working in her stepmom's indie comic shop, she's prepping for the biggest audition of her life.</p> <p>Ridley is barely holding it together. His parents own the biggest comic-store chain in the country, and Ridley can't stop disappointing them - that is, when they're even paying attention.</p> <p>They meet one fateful night at a comic convention prom, and the two can't help falling for each other. Too bad their parents are at each other's throats every chance they get, making a relationship between them nearly impossible...unless they manage to keep it a secret.</p> <p>Then again, the feud between their families may be the least of their problems. As Ridley's anxiety spirals, Jubilee tries to help but finds her focus torn between her fast-approaching audition and their intensifying relationship. What if love can't conquer all? What if each of them needs more than the other can give?</p> <p><b>\"A deep dive into first love while learning to manage significant mental health challenges...Dugan's strength is in creating a diverse cast of characters. Ridley is bisexual, Jubilee struggles with how to identify and label her sexuality, and most of the supporting characters are queer-identified.\"(</b><b><i>School Library Journal</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
