window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>California’s San Francisco Bay Area is home to an incredible renaissance to rival that of the Italians in the 15th and 16th centuries. But instead of working with oils and marble, creators like Tim Cook, Sergey Brin, and Mark Zuckerberg work with code and computer chips.</p> <p>In 10 episodes written by John McLaughlin, president of the Silicon Valley Historical Association, <i>The Entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley </i>reveals the fascinating story of entrepreneurship, invention, and innovation in the most risk-friendly place on the planet. Bringing together three decades of research and interviews, McLaughlin takes you inside the minds of the founders of giants like Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Intel, Adobe, Intuit, and other revolutionary companies. It's these innovators themselves who can bring the stories of Silicon Valley to life better than anyone, and in their own words they’ll recount their struggles, their successes - and even their failures.</p> <p>You’ll also come to see this stretch of Northern California as a place of constant transformation, a region with perpetual ties to science, wealth, and power. Spanning over 100 years of history, these episodes recount the rise of Stanford University and the valley’s first high-tech company, Federal Telegraph; and they continue through world-changing innovations in times of war and peace, right up to the birth of the internet, the dot-com bubble, and beyond. The episodes also include the history of video gaming, the emergence of cell phones and search engines, and the invention of social media networks that continue to shape how we live today.</p> <p>Apple, Google, Adobe, Facebook - you use products and services by these and other tech giants every single day. Guess what? They all started right here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
