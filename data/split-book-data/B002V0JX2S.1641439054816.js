Lewis - the great British writer, scholar, theologian, broadcaster, Christian apologist, and bestselling author of <i>Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, The Great Divorce, The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, and many other beloved classics - explores the essence of love and how it works in our daily lives in one of his most famous works of nonfiction based on his series of radio talks from 1958.</p> <p>With penetrating logic and charming wit, Lewis explores the four aspects of love: affection, the most basic form; friendship, the rarest and perhaps most insightful; Eros, passionate love; and charity, the greatest and least selfish.</p> <p>Lewis exposes the pitfalls in our loves, leading us to the agape love that God has for humankind and the type of love we must develop to nurture our relationships. Throughout this compassionate and methodical study, he encourages readers to open themselves to all forms of love - the key to understanding that brings us closer to God.</p> <ul> <li>Features vintage BBC narration by C.S. Lewis</li> <li>New introduction and commentary by Charles Colson</li> <li>Discussion questions available in the audiobook companion PDF download</li> </ul> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
