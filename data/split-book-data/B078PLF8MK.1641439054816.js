window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Rowan and Citra take opposite stances on the morality of the Scythedom, putting them at odds, in the chilling sequel to the Printz Honor Book <i>Scythe</i> from <i>New York Times</i> best seller Neal Shusterman, author of the <i>Unwind</i> dystology. </p> <p>The Thunderhead cannot interfere in the affairs of the Scythedom. All it can do is observe â€” it does not like what it sees. </p> <p>A year has passed since Rowan had gone off grid. Since then, he has become an urban legend, a vigilante snuffing out corrupt scythes in a trial by fire. His story is told in whispers across the continent. </p> <p>As Scythe Anastasia, Citra gleans with compassion and openly challenges the ideals of the \"new order\". But when her life is threatened and her methods questioned, it becomes clear that not everyone is open to the change. </p> <p>Will the Thunderhead intervene? </p> <p>Or will it simply watch as this perfect world begins to unravel? </p>";
