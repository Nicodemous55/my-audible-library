When warrior angels fly away with a helpless little girl, her 17-year-old sister, Penryn, will do anything to get her back. </p> <p>Anything, including making a deal with an enemy angel. </p> <p>Raffe is a warrior who lies broken and wingless on the street. After eons of fighting his own battles, he finds himself being rescued from a desperate situation by a half-starved teenage girl. </p> <p>Traveling through a dark and twisted Northern California, they have only each other to rely on for survival. Together, they journey toward the angels’ stronghold in San Francisco where Penryn will risk everything to rescue her sister, and Raffe will put himself at the mercy of his greatest enemies for the chance to be made whole again.</p>";
