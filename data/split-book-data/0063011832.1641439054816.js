window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Perfect for fans of </b><b><i>99 Days</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Anna and the French Kiss</i></b><b>, this unforgettable, sun-drenched summer romance from one of YA’s best-selling and most beloved authors, Sarah Mlynowski, is an irresistible dive into the joys of seizing the day and embracing the unexpected. </b></p> <p>Sam’s summer isn’t off to a great start. Her boyfriend, Eli, ditched her for a European backpacking trip, and now she’s a counselor at Camp Blue Springs: the summer camp her to which 11-year-old self swore never to return. Sam expects the next seven weeks to be a total disaster. That is, until she meets Gavin, the camp’s sailing instructor, who turns her expectations upside down.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gavin may have gotten the job just for his abs. Or that smile. Or the way he fills Sam’s free time with thrilling encounters - swimming under a cascade of stars, whispering secrets over s’mores, embarking on one (very precarious) canoe ride after dark. It’s absurd. After all, Sam loves Eli. But one totally absurd, completely off-the-wall summer may be just what Sam needs. And maybe, just maybe, it will teach her something about what she really wants.&nbsp;</p>";
