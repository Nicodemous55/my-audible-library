window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We all make poor financial decisions sometimes. No one knows this better than J.D. Roth.</p> <p>In 2004, deep in financial debt, Roth resolved to turn things around. Reading every money book he could, and putting that knowledge into practice, he dug himself out of debt and built enough wealth to retire early. He is now, at the age of 51, financially independent - and on a mission to help others achieve financial freedom, too. No gimmicks, no games. Just proven methods that work.</p> <p>In this audiobook, Roth takes you inside the trending world of financial independence and early retirement, giving you the tools both to achieve financial independence and to improve the quality of your everyday life. You'll explore the ins and outs of the \"FIRE movement\", a collection of ideas and habits that allow people to manage their money so they can quit working while they're young. You'll consider the shockingly simple math behind financial freedom. You'll also examine the philosophy and psychology of how - and why - we spend, save, and invest.&nbsp;</p> <p>Financial freedom is possible. And no matter what your goals are, these 10 lessons will bring you closer than ever to achieving what that freedom means: happiness, fulfillment, and a rich life.</p>";
