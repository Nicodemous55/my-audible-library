window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling love story about two teens who find each other while standing on the edge is soon to be a Netflix film starring Elle Fanning and Justice Smith!</b></p> <p><b>Theodore Finch</b> is fascinated by death, and he constantly thinks of ways he might die. But each time, something good, no matter how small, stops him.</p> <p><b>Violet Markey</b> lives for the future, counting the days until graduation, when she can escape her Indiana town and her aching grief in the wake of her sister's recent death.</p> <p>When Finch and Violet meet on the ledge of the bell tower at school, it's unclear who saves whom. And when they pair up on a project to discover the \"natural wonders\" of their state, both Finch and Violet make more important discoveries: It's only with Violet that Finch can be himself - a weird, funny, live-out-loud guy who's not such a freak after all. And it's only with Finch that Violet can forget to count away the days and start living them. But as Violet's world grows, Finch's begins to shrink.</p> <p><b>Please note: Includes a PDF Help Line Resource Guide, available in your Audible Library, and a Note read by the author.</b></p>";
