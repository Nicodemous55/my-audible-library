window.bookSummaryJSON = "Lively, absorbing, often outrageously funny, Chaucer's <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> is a work of genius, an undisputed classic that has held a special appeal for each generation of readers. The Tales gathers 29 of literature's most enduring (and endearing) characters in a vivid group portrait that captures the full spectrum of medieval society, from the exalted Knight to the humble Plowman. This unabridged work is based on the new translation.";
