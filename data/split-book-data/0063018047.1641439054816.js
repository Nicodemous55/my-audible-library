Sarah can’t help but be curious about him, an animal who supposedly doesn’t have a soul but who is seemingly intent on keeping her safe.</p> <p>Because the dragon knows something she doesn’t.&nbsp;He has arrived at the farm with a prophecy on his mind. A prophecy that involves a deadly assassin, a cult of dragon worshippers, two FBI agents in hot pursuit - and somehow, Sarah Dewhurst herself.&nbsp;</p>";
