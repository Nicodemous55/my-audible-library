window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Rhys Bowen comes a haunting novel about a woman who braves her father's hidden past to discover his secrets....</b> </p> <p>In 1944, British bomber pilot Hugo Langley parachuted from his stricken plane into the verdant fields of German-occupied Tuscany. Badly wounded, he found refuge in a ruined monastery and in the arms of Sofia Bartoli. But the love that kindled between them was shaken by an irreversible betrayal. </p> <p>Nearly 30 years later, Hugo's estranged daughter, Joanna, has returned home to the English countryside to arrange her father's funeral. Among his personal effects is an unopened letter addressed to Sofia. In it is a startling revelation. </p> <p>Still dealing with the emotional wounds of her own personal trauma, Joanna embarks on a healing journey to Tuscany to understand her father's history - and maybe come to understand herself as well. Joanna soon discovers that some would prefer the past be left undisturbed, but she has come too far to let go of her father's secrets now.... </p> <p><b>Cover design by Shasti O'Leary Soudant</b> </p>";
