window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"If you're into snarky heroines, murder mysteries, kickass fight scenes, wild new worlds, and a dah of romance - Sunaya is your girl!\" (Angela Roquet, </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> best-selling author</b>)</p> <p>This boxed set contains the first seven books in the complete Baine Chronicles Series by <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Author Jasmine Walt. This kick-ass urban fantasy series has been compared to books by Ilona Andrews, Patricia Briggs, Karen Marie Moning, and more. You're sure to enjoy it if you like spunky heroines, kick-ass fight scenes, wild new worlds and sizzling, slow-building romance.&nbsp;</p> <p>From the inside flap of book one:&nbsp;</p> <p>In the city of Solantha, mages rule absolute, with shifters considered second-class citizens and humans something in between. No one outside the mage families are allowed to have magic, and anyone born with it must agree to have it stripped from them to avoid execution.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sunaya Baine, a shifter-mage hybrid, has managed to keep her unruly magic under wraps for the last twenty-four years. But while chasing down a shifter-hunting serial killer, she accidentally loses control of her magic in front of witnesses, drawing the attention of the dangerous and enigmatic Chief Mage.&nbsp;</p> <p>Locked up in the Chief Mageâ€™s castle and reduced to little more than a lab rat, Sunaya resists his attempts to analyze and control her at every turn. But she soon realizes that to regain her freedom and catch the killer, she must overcome her hatred of mages and win the most powerful mage of all to her side.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Scroll up to get this boxed set for 85 percent off!</b></p>";
