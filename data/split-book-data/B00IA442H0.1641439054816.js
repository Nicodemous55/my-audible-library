I’ve seen the movies. I know the song about the rainbow and the happy little bluebirds. But I never expected Oz to look like this. To be a place where Good Witches can’t be trusted, Wicked Witches may just be the good guys, and winged monkeys can be executed for acts of rebellion.

They say she seized power and the power went to her head. And now no one is safe. </p> <p>My name is Amy Gumm - and I’m the other girl from Kansas. </p> <p>I've been recruited by the Revolutionary Order of the Wicked. </p> <p>I’ve been trained to fight. </p> <p>And I have a mission.</p>";
