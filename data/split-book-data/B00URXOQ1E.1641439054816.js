window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The 13 chapters of <i>The Art of War</i>, each devoted to one aspect of warfare, were compiled by the high-ranking Chinese military general, strategist, and philosopher Sun-Tzu. In spite of its battlefield specificity, <i>The Art of War</i> has found new life in the modern age, with leaders in fields as wide and far-reaching as world politics, human psychology, and corporate strategy finding valuable insight in its timeworn words. </p> <p>Aidan Gillen - who has learned a thing or two about strategy through his roles as skilled manipulator Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish (<i>Game of Thrones</i>) and ambitious politician Tommy Carcetti (<i>The Wire</i>) - brilliantly performs this ancient classic. His experience in portraying insightful and, at times, cunning characters makes him a natural fit for this ancient collection of battlefield epigrams whose influence has grown tremendously in the modern world.</p>";
