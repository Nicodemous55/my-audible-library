window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>The Book of Dust</i>, the long-awaited new novel from Philip Pullman set in the world of His Dark Materials and narrated by Michael Sheen, has been hailed by the <i>New York Times</i> as \"a stunning achievement.\" Find it on audio from Listening Library.</b> </p> <p><b>An exciting tale set in the world of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials saga </b> </p> <p><i>Lyra's Oxford</i> opens in the thrilling comfort and familiarity of Jordan College, where Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon sit on the sun-drenched roof looking out over all of Oxford. But their peace is shattered when a strange bird (a witch's daemon, on its own) tumbles out of the sky. It is Ragi, daemon of Yelena Pazhets, and he seeks a healing elixir from an infamous Oxford alchemist (and rumored man-slaughterer) to cure his witch of a strange new disease from the South. Lyra and Pan decide to help and guide him (witches are friends, of course), but the closer their winding walk leads them to the alchemist's house, the stronger Lyra's sense that she's walking into a deadly trap. </p>";
