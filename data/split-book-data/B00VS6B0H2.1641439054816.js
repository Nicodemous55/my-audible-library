window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award, Middle Grade, 2016 </b></p> <p>Music, magic, and a real-life miracle meld in this virtuosic, genre-defying tour de force from storytelling maestro Pam Mu√±oz Ryan. </p> <p>Lost and alone in the forbidden Black Forest, Otto meets three mysterious sisters and suddenly finds himself entwined in a puzzling quest involving a prophecy, a promise, and a harmonica. Decades later Friedrich in Germany, Mike in Pennsylvania, and Ivy in California each becomes interwoven when the very same harmonica lands in their lives, binding them by an invisible thread of destiny. All the children face daunting challenges: rescuing a father, protecting a brother, holding a family together. How their suspenseful solo stories converge in an orchestral crescendo will resound in your heart long after the last note has been struck. </p> <p>Richly imagined and structurally innovative, <i>Echo</i> pushes the boundaries of form and shows us what is possible in how we tell stories. With music by Corky Siegel. </p>";
