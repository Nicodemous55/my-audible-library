window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The definitive, revelatory biography of Marvel Comics icon Stan Lee, a writer and entrepreneur who reshaped global pop culture - at a steep personal cost. </b></p> <p><b>\"A&nbsp;biography that reads like a thriller or a whodunit...scrupulously honest, deeply damning, and sometimes even heartbreaking.\" (Neil Gaiman) </b></p> <p>Stan Lee was one of the most famous and beloved entertainers to emerge from the 20th century. He served as head editor of Marvel Comics for three decades and, in that time, became known as the creator of more pieces of internationally recognizable intellectual property than nearly anyone: Spider-Man, the Avengers, the X-Men, Black Panther, the Incredible Hulk...the list goes on. His carnival-barker marketing prowess helped save the comic-book industry and superhero fiction. His cameos in Marvel movies have charmed billions. When he died in 2018, grief poured in from around the world, further cementing his legacy.</p> <p>But what if Stan Lee wasn’t who he said he was? To craft the definitive biography of Lee, Abraham Riesman conducted more than 150 interviews and investigated thousands of pages of private documents, turning up never-before-published revelations about Lee’s life and work. <i>True Believer </i>tackles tough questions: Did Lee <i>actually</i> create the characters he gained fame for creating? Was he complicit in millions of dollars’ worth of fraud in his post-Marvel life? Which members of the cavalcade of grifters who surrounded him were most responsible for the misery of his final days?</p> <p>And, above all, what drove this man to achieve so much yet always boast of more?&nbsp;</p>";
