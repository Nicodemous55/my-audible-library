window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We are all indigenous to the planet Earth - and that is why each of us can benefit from indigenous wisdom. Throughout their history, the Lakota people developed many enduring insights and practices for achieving harmony with all the forces in our life - including the land, the spirits, our community, and ourselves. </p> <p>On <i>Living the Lakota Way,</i> Joseph M. Marshall explores how you can apply the core principles of Lakota Wisdom to your own life, no matter who you are or where you come from. Through his gifts as a storyteller, Joseph Marshall brings Lakota history and lore to life with his words. With each piece of Lakota tradition he shares, Joseph offers a special focus on the aspects that are most valuable and relevant to us today in our own lives. How do we choose the heroes that we honor? Where do we find the strength to make it through challenging times? How do we relate to the earth, to our ancestors, and to the profound mystery of the spirit world? The Lakota tradition, as Joseph Marshall imparts it, can provide us with much-needed guidance for finding answers to the essential questions of our lives.</p>";
