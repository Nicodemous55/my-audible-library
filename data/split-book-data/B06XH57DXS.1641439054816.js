window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Putting a century of scholarship on one of the world's most enduring popular novels into accessible, narrative form, this new approach to a classic of world literature is written for a wide general audience. Packed full of information about the book's origins and later career on stage and screen, <i>The Novel of the Century</i> brings to life the extraordinary story of how Victor Hugo managed to write his novel of the downtrodden despite a revolution, a coup d'etat, and political exile; how he pulled off the deal of the century to get it published; and how he set it on course to become the novel that epitomizes the grand sweep of history in the 19th century. This biography of a masterpiece also shows how and why the moral and social messages of <i>Les Miserables</i> are full of meaning for our time. </p>";
