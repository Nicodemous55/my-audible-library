window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the Imagine Network commissioned a documentary on mermaids, to be filmed from the cruise ship Atargatis, they expected what they had always received before: an assortment of eyewitness reports that proved nothing, some footage that proved even less, and the kind of ratings that only came from peddling imaginary creatures to the masses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>They didn't expect actual mermaids. They certainly didn't expect those mermaids to have teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the story of the Atargatis, lost at sea with all hands. Some have called it a hoax; others have called it a maritime tragedy. Whatever the truth may be, it will only be found below the bathypelagic zone in the Mariana Trench...and the depths are very good at keeping secrets.</p>";
