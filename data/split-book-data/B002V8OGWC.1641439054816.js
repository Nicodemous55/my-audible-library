Is young Merlin destined to be a powerful wizard, or does he have a choice? <p> These are the questions Merlin must answer as he travels with the deer woman Hallia to the Haunted Marsh, where the marsh ghouls have begun a campaign of destruction. Or are the ghouls being manipulated by an even greater source of evil? An evil that seeks to destroy not the marsh, but Merlin himself.</p> <p> Here, in the fourth installment of the <i>Lost Years of Merlin</i> epic, master storyteller T.A. Barron weaves a tale of humor, adventure, and surprise.
