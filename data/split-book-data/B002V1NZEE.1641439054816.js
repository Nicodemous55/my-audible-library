(And you, dear listener, can test your wits right alongside them.)</p> <p>Only four children - Reynie, Kate, Sticky, and Constance - succeed. Their challenge: to go on a secret mission that only the most intelligent and inventive children could complete. To accomplish it, they will have to go undercover at the Learning Institute for the Very Enlightened, where the only rule is that there are no rules. But what they'll find in the hidden labyrinth of the school's underground tunnels is more than your average school supplies.</p> <p>First time children's novelist Trenton Lee Stewart takes listeners on an adventure that puts friends, family, and foe to the test. Are you up to the challenge?</p>";
