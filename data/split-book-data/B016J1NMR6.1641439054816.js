window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award, History/Biography, 2016 </b></p> <p>This acclaimed portrait of heroism and ingenuity captures a watershed moment in human history. The astronauts themselves have called it the definitive account of their missions. On the night of July 20, 1969, our world changed forever when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon. Based on in-depth interviews with 23 of the 24 moon voyagers, as well as those who struggled to get the program moving, <i>A Man on the Moon</i> conveys every aspect of the Apollo missions with breathtaking immediacy and stunning detail. </p>";
