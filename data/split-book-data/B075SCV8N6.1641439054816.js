Even though their meetings are more real to Lucy than the present, Lucy is uncertain if Will exists outside her mind. Lucy's mum thinks there is something wrong when Lucy sleeps for days at a time. She is so caught up with finding a cure she doesn't see the real problem. Lucy is bullied at school and is thinking of ending her life. When the bullying goes too far and Lucy ends up in a coma, only Will can reach her. But how do you live when the only person who can save you doesn't exist? </p>";
