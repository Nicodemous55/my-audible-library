With a college-bound future now disappearing before her eyes, Veronica considers a decision she never imagined she'd have to make: an abortion.There's just one catch - the closest place to get one is over nine hundred miles away. With conservative parents, a less-than-optimal boyfriend, and no car, Veronica turns to the only person who won't judge her: Bailey Butler, a legendary misfit at Jefferson High - and Veronica's ex-best friend.</p> <p>What could go wrong? Not much, apart from three days of stolen cars, crazed ex-boyfriends, aliens, ferret napping, and the betrayal of a broken friendship that can't be outrun. Under the starlit skies of the Southwest, Veronica and Bailey discover that sometimes the most important choice is who your friends are.</p> <p>This breakout novel is from authors Jenni Hendriks (writer for <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>) and Ted Caplan (music editor for <i>The Hate U Give</i>).</p> <p><b>\"A stellar, timely debut.\" (</b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><b>, starred review)</b></p> <p><b>\"Timely, hilarious, and heartfelt.\" (</b><b><i>Kirkus</i></b><b>, starred review)</b></p>";
