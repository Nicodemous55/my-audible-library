The iconic books on the list have been pulled from the library and aren’t allowed anywhere on the school’s premises. Students caught with the contraband will be sternly punished.</p> <p>Many of these stories have changed Clara’s life, so she’s not going to sit back and watch while her draconian principal abuses his power. She’s going to strike back.</p> <p>So Clara starts an underground library in her locker, doing a shady trade in titles like <i>Speak</i> and <i>The Chocolate War</i>. But when one of the books she loves most is connected to a tragedy she never saw coming, Clara’s forced to face her role in it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Will she be able to make peace with her conflicting feelings, or is fighting for this noble cause too tough for her to bear?</p> <p><b>“</b><b><i>Suggested Reading</i></b><b>&nbsp;is a beautiful reminder that there is nothing simple about loving a book.” (David Arnold,&nbsp;</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>&nbsp;best-selling author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Mosquitoland</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
