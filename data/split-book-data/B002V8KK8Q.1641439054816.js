window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Exclusively from Audible</b> </p>In this coming of age story, Dodie Smith introduces the visionary and eccentric character of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain. The youngest daughter in a family of impoverished artists, it is her imagination and writing that takes us away from the ramshackle old English castle where they live, and towards an intriguing tale of husband-hunting and light-hearted sibling rivalry. <p></p> <p>With the arrival of their new landlords, the impossibly handsome and wealthy American brothers, Neil and Simon Cotton, the Mortmains are roused from their stupor and moved to action. Despite developing feelings for the younger of the two brothers, Cassandra's beautiful sister, Rose, plots to marry the eldest heir in a desperate attempt to escape the poverty which surrounds her. </p> <p>When Cassandra finds herself falling in love for the very first time with the same man as her sister, she explores her mixed emotions through her writing, making this a story which revels in irony and ambiguity. </p> <p>A deceptively complex and intelligent story, <i>I Capture the Castle</i> is Smith's first published work and one which will undoubtedly and simultaneously make listeners tut, laugh and reminisce. </p> <i>Narrator Biography</i> <p></p> <p>Jenny Agutter is a celebrated English stage, film and TV actress who was first brought to the attention of British audiences as a child, starring in <i>East of Sudan</i> and <i>The Railway Children</i>.
