window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We all need a place to escape from the real world.</p> <p>For Divya and Aaron, it’s the world of online gaming. While Divya trades her rising-star status for sponsorships to help her struggling single mom pay rent, Aaron plays as a way to fuel his own dreams of becoming a game developer – and as a way to disappear when his mom starts talking about medical school. After a chance online meeting, the pair decides to team up – but soon find themselves the targets of a group of internet trolls who begin launching a real-world doxxing campaign, threatening Aaron’s dream and Divya’s actual life. They think can drive her out of the game, but Divya’s whole world is on the line….</p> <p>And she isn’t going down without a fight.</p> <p>“Wonderfully geeky and deeply compassionate.” (Marieke Nijkamp, number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author)&nbsp;</p>";
