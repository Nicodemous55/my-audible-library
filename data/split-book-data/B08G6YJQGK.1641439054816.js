window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One minute they’re purring next to us, the next they’re attacking our toes, yet for all their mysterious and quirky ways, we can’t help but love these little lions we’ve let into our homes and our hearts.&nbsp;</p> <p>Whether you’re a cat mom or dad or just want to know more about the way domesticated animals evolved, think, and behave, join Dr. Kristyn Vitale, a researcher in the Human-Animal Interaction Lab at Oregon State University, to get inside the mind of the curious, the cute, and sometimes seemingly crazy cat.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over 10 lectures. Dr. Vitale will take you through the inscrutable characteristics of cat behavior. She’ll introduce you to cat activities - cat’tivities! - such as socialization and enrichment, which can help to increase your cat’s well-being. She’ll also dispel the common myth that you can’t train a cat - showing you how to both train your cat to do the behaviors you want and correct behaviors you don’t want your cat doing. And she’ll guide you through the evolution of this purrfect pet - from a wild animal to how it become the unique house cat sleeping on your bed.</p> <p>You’ll find that the more you can decode your cat’s behavior, the stronger your bond with them will be.</p>";
