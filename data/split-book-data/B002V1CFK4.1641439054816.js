window.bookSummaryJSON = "Remy always knows the perfect time to give a boyfriend \"The Speech\" telling him it's over - after the initial romantic whirl, but before the reality of an actual relationship hits. Her friends tease that her boyfriend tally is nearing the triple digit mark, but she's a girl who knows just how to avoid any messy emotional entanglement. After all, she's had the example of her five-times-married mother to show her what not to do. <p>So what, then, is it about Dexter that makes it so hard for her to follow her own rules? He's everything she hates: messy, disorganized, much too vulnerable, impulsive, and worst of all, a musician like her father - the father Remy never knew, the father who wrote a famous song for her, the father who disappeared from her life. </p> <p>Sarah Dessen's most captivating novel yet introduces readers to a girl who believes her heart is made of stone - and the boy who proves her wrong.</p>";
