Debut author Lyla Lee delivers a deliciously fun, thoughtful rom-com celebrating confidence and body positivity - perfect for fans of Jenny Han and Julie Murphy.</b></p> <p>Skye Shin has heard it all. Fat girls shouldn’t dance. Wear bright colors. Shouldn’t call attention to themselves. But Skye dreams of joining the glittering world of K-Pop, and to do that, she’s about to break all the rules that society, the media, and even her own mother, have set for girls like her.</p> <p>She’ll challenge thousands of other performers in an internationally televised competition looking for the next K-pop star, and she’ll do it better than anyone else.</p> <p>When Skye nails her audition, she’s immediately swept into a whirlwind of countless practices, shocking performances, and the drama that comes with reality TV. What she doesn’t count on are the highly fat-phobic beauty standards of the Korean pop entertainment industry, her sudden media fame and scrutiny, or the sparks that soon fly with her fellow competitor, Henry Cho.</p> <p>But Skye has her sights on becoming the world’s first plus-sized K-pop star, and that means winning the competition - <i>without</i> losing herself.</p>";
