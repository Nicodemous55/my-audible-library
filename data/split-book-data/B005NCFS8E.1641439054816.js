window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A brand new edition of the long unavailable children’s story, written by the author of <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>Letters from Father Christmas</i>, with newly scanned manuscript pages and redesigned text. Now available as a downloadable audio edition.</p> <p> Professor J.R.R. Tolkien invented and illustrated the book of Mr Bliss’s adventures for his own children when they were very young. This is a complete and highly imaginative tale of eccentricity.</p> <p> Mr Bliss, a man notable for his immensely tall hats and for the girabbit in his garden, takes the whimsical decision to buy a motor car. But his first drive to visit friends quickly becomes a catalogue of disasters. Some of these could be blamed on Mr Bliss’s style of driving, but even he could not anticipate being hijacked by three bears. As for what happened next – the listeners, whether young or old, will want to discover for themselves. Thankfully all ended well, and even the yellow motor car with red wheels (to which Mr Bliss has taken an understandable and great dislike), came in useful at the end.</p>";
