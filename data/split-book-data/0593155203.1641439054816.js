Eleven months after the school shooting that killed her twin brother, May still doesn't know why she was the only one to walk out of the band room that day.

No one can possibly understand how it feels to be her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Zach lost his old life when his mother decided to defend the shooter. His girlfriend dumped him, his friends bailed, and now he spends his time hanging out with his little sister...and the one faithful friend who stuck around. His best friend is needy and demanding, but he won't let Zach disappear into himself. Which is how Zach ends up at band practice that night. The <i>same</i> night May goes with her best friend to audition for a new band.&nbsp;</p> <p>Which is how May meets Zach. And how Zach meets May.
