She’s managed to piece together a solid life from a childhood of broken memories and fairy tales her mom told her to explain away bad dreams.

It’s just another of so many unanswered questions she grew up with in a family estranged by silence and secrets.</p> <p>Elle’s world turns upside down when she receives a deathbed request from her grandfather, a man she was told had died years ago. Racked by grief, regrets, and a haunted conscience, he has a tale of his own to tell Elle: about her mother, an imaginary friend, and two strangers who came to the house one night and never left.</p> <p>As Elle’s past unfolds, so does the truth - if she can believe it. She must face the reasons for her inexplicable dread. As dark as they are, Elle must listen…before her grandfather’s death buries the family’s secrets forever.</p>";
