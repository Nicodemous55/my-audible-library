On an annual basis, the industry is even more profitable than Hollywood. Today’s video games feature stunning, lifelike visuals and complex storylines - but they didn’t start out that way.&nbsp;</p> <p>The origin of video games can be traced back to World War II. In the 10 lectures of <i>A History of Video Games</i>, listeners will follow the development of the digital game from its roots in the war room to its proliferation in the 21st-century living room. Taught by journalist, podcast host, and video game historian Jeremy Parish, this lively course will track the tremendous leaps made in computing technology that allowed games to become increasingly sophisticated and the popular trends that pushed the boundaries of technology forward.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story of video games is not just about technology. It’s also about popular culture, economics, and globalization. Throughout these lectures, students will learn about the extremely profitable gaming industry, as well as the creative minds and ambitious projects that helped build it - and even encounter a few spectacular failures. Be prepared to:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Witness the precipitous rise and fall of Atari</li> <li>Experience the birth of blockbuster gaming systems like NES and Sega Genesis</li> <li>Learn about the evolution of the console, PC, and portable gaming</li> <li>Explore the creation of iconic game series, such as <i>Mario Bros.</i>,<i> Pac-Man, </i>and <i>Pokémon</i>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>From the simple pleasures of <i>Pong </i>to the complex online world of <i>Fortnite</i>, video games have come a long way over the course of seven decades, with no signs of slowing down anytime soon.
