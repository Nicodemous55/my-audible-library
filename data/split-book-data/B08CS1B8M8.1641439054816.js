window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>These 18 darkly complex short stories and novellas touch upon human nature and perception, metaphysics and epistemology, and gender and sexuality, foreshadowing a world in which biological tendencies bring about the downfall of humankind. Revisions from the author's notes are included, allowing a deeper view into her world and a better understanding of her work. The Nebula Award-winning short story \"Love Is the Plan, the Plan Is Death\", the Hugo Award-winning novella <i>The Girl Who Was Plugged In</i>, and the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novella <i>Houston, Houston, Do You Read?</i> are included.&nbsp;</p> <p>The stories of Alice Sheldon, who wrote as James Tiptree Jr. (<i>Up the Walls of the World</i>) until her death in 1987, have been heretofore available mostly in out-of-print collections. Thus the 18 accomplished stories here will be welcomed by new listeners and old fans. ''The Screwfly Solution'' describes a chilling, elegant answer to the population problem. In ''Love Is the Plan the Plan Is Death,'' the title tells the tale - species survival insured by imprinted drives - but the story's force is in its exquisite, lyrical prose and its suggestion that personal uniqueness is possible even within biological imperatives. ''The Girl Who Was Plugged In'' is a future boy-meets-girl story with a twist unexpected by the players. ''The Women Men Don't See'' displays Tiptree's keen insight and ability to depict singularity within the ordinary. In Hugo and Nebula award-winning ''Houston, Houston, Do You Read?'' astronauts flying by the sun slip forward 500 years and encounter a culture that successfully questions gender roles in ours.</p>";
