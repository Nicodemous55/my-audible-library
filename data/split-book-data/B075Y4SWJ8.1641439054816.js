window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award, 2019: Faith-Based Fiction and Nonfiction</b></p> <p><b>Audiofile</b><b><i> </i></b><b>Earphones Award Winner</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Man on the Mountaintop</i> tells the story of Holy Man Joe, an ageing and unassuming man who lives in a hermitage on top of a mountain. During the summer months, thousands of hopefuls line the single-file path leading to his door, seeking his wisdom. From bombastic, wealthy nobles intent on cheating their way to the top to drunkards who gradually build the physical and mental strength they need to quit their addiction, <i>The Man on the Mountaintop</i> is a rousing tale full of humour, wit and life lessons.&nbsp;</p> <p>In an Audible Originals production, Stanley Tucci (<i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>, <i>Fortitude</i>) and Toby Jones (<i>Infamous</i>, <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i>) lead a multivoice cast in an inspiring tale that is as entertaining as it is profound.&nbsp;</p> <p>Also featuring Alison Dowling, Anne Rosenfeld, Avita Jay, Christophe Hespel, Christopher Ragland, Clare Corbett, David Thorpe, Fran Canals, Hayward B. Morse, Jeff Harding, Lachele Carl, Laurence Bouvard, Liza Ross, Lobo Chan, Martin T Sherman, Paul Panting, Rachel Atkins, Richard Rees, Sagar Arya, Sheena Bhattessa, Stephen Hogan and Tim Bentinck.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A note from the author, Susan Trott:</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Dear Listeners, </i></p> <p><i>I was having trouble getting to sleep at night. Instead of counting sheep, I found myself counting people going up a mountain to see a holy man. Each night, semiconscious, I came to know this holy man and the pilgrims. </i></p> <p><i>My insomnia problem was solved. Now I had a story to write. I wrote it quickly, although years later, when asked how long it took to write, I said 50 years, which was also true. </i></p> <p><i>Recently the Dalai Lama said, 'You don't have to believe in God to be a kind and compassionate person.' Joe, our man on the mountaintop, would agree. </i>&nbsp;</p>";
