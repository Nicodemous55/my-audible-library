window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Combined into one volume, this is the definitive collection of Tolkien's five acclaimed modern classic 'fairie' tales in the vein of <i>The Hobbit</i>, read by Derek Jacobi. </p> <p>The five tales are written with the same skill, quality and charm that made <i>The Hobbit</i> a classic. Largely overlooked because of their short lengths, they are joined here in one volume which reaffirms Tolkien's place as a master storyteller for listeners young and old. </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>'Roverandom' is a toy dog who, enchanted by a sand sorcerer, gets to explore the world and encounter strange and fabulous creatures. </li> <li>'Farmer Giles of Ham' is fat and unheroic, but - having unwittingly managed to scare off a short-sighted giant - is called upon to do battle when a dragon comes to town. </li> <li>'The Adventures of Tom Bombadil' tells in verse of Tom's many adventures with hobbits, princesses, dwarves and trolls. </li> <li>'Leaf by Niggle' recounts the strange adventures of the painter Niggle, who sets out to paint the perfect tree. </li> <li>'Smith of Wootton Major' journeys to the Land of Faery thanks to the magical ingredients of the Great Cake of the Feast of Good Children. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Taken together, this rich collection of work from the author of <i>The Children of Húrin</i> will provide the listener with a fascinating journey into lands as wild and strange as Middle-earth.</p>";
