When it comes to speaking to strangers (or, let’s face it, speaking <i>at all</i> to almost anyone) Jamie’s a choke artist. There’s no way he’d ever knock on doors to ask people for their votes...until he meets Maya.&nbsp;</p> <p>NO&nbsp;</p> <p>Maya Rehman’s having the worst Ramadan ever. Her best friend is too busy to hang out, her summer trip is canceled, and now her parents are separating. Why her mother thinks the solution to her problems is <i>political canvassing </i>- with some awkward dude she hardly knows - is beyond her.&nbsp;</p> <p>MAYBE SO&nbsp;</p> <p>Going door to door isn’t exactly glamorous, but maybe it’s not the worst thing in the world. After all, the polls are getting closer - and so are Maya and Jamie. Mastering local activism is one thing. Navigating the cross-cultural crush of the century is another thing entirely.</p>";
