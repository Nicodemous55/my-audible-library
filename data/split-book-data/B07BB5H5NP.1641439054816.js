window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Soon to be a major motion picture, this is the first - and only - definitive authorized account of Neil Armstrong, the man whose “one small step” changed history.</b></p> <p>When Apollo 11 touched down on the Moon’s surface in 1969, the first man on the Moon became a legend. In <i>First Man</i>, author James R. Hansen explores the life of Neil Armstrong. Based on over 50 hours of interviews with the intensely private Armstrong, who also gave Hansen exclusive access to private documents and family sources, this \"magnificent panorama of the second half of the American twentieth century\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review) is an unparalleled biography of an American icon.</p> <p>In this “compelling and nuanced portrait” (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>) filled with revelations, Hansen vividly recreates Armstrong’s career in flying, from his 78 combat missions as a naval aviator flying over North Korea to his formative trans-atmospheric flights in the rocket-powered X-15 to his piloting Gemini VIII to the first-ever docking in space. For a pilot who cared more about flying to the Moon than he did about walking on it, Hansen asserts, Armstrong’s storied vocation exacted a dear personal toll, paid in kind by his wife and children. For the near-50 years since the Moon landing, rumors have swirled around Armstrong concerning his dreams of space travel, his religious beliefs, and his private life.</p> <p>A penetrating exploration of American hero worship, Hansen addresses the complex legacy of the First Man, as an astronaut and as an individual. “<i>First Man</i> burrows deep into Armstrong’s past and present.... What emerges is an earnest and brave man” (<i>Houston Chronicle</i>) who will forever be known as history’s most famous space traveler.</p>";
