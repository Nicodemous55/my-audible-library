window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Nalo Hopkinson, author of <i>Brown Girl in the Ring</i>, <i>The Salt Roads</i>, and <i>Sister Mine</i>, is an internationally-beloved storyteller. Hailed by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> as having \"an imagination that most of us would kill for,\" her Afro-Caribbean, Canadian, and American influences shine in truly unique stories that are filled with striking imagery, unlikely beauty, and delightful strangeness.</p> <p>In this long-awaited collection, Hopkinson continues to expand the boundaries of culture and imagination. Whether she is retelling <i>The Tempest</i> as a new Caribbean myth, filling a shopping mall with unfulfilled ghosts, or herding chickens that occasionally breathe fire, Hopkinson continues to create bold fiction that transcends boundaries and borders.</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
