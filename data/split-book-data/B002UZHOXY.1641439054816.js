window.bookSummaryJSON = "Foraging in fields and on rubbish heaps, and sharing food with his friend Crane-man, used to be enough to fill Tree-ear's days. But now all Tree-ear wants to do is watch master potter Min at work. <p>Ch'ulp'o is a potters' village, famous for delicate celadon ware, and Min is the most brilliant of all potters in Ch'ulp'o. He is also known to be short-tempered. Even so, Tree-ear is drawn irresistibly to Min's workplace. He is fascinated by the miracle of the potter's craft and dream of making a pot of his own someday. His quest leads him down unexpected paths, with hazards and rewards beyond imagining.</p> <p>This account of a creative spirit on its journey toward fulfillment is set in twelfth-century Korea, where the course of human destiny could be determined by a single celadon shard.</p> <p><i>A Single Shard<i> won the 2002 Newbery Medal for most distinguished American children's book.</i></i></p>";
