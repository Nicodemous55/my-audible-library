window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The phenomenal epic of good and evil like it's never been experienced before </b></p> <p>Thirty-five years ago, Terry Brooks brought to life a dazzling world in <i>The Sword of Shannara</i>. Nineteen more Shannara volumes would follow, making the series one of the most popular fantasy epics of all time. Now comes a fully annotated collector's edition of the novel that started it all - featuring never-before-shared insights into the classic tale and an all-new introduction by the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author.</p> <p>Long ago, wars ravaged the world. In peaceful Shady Vale, half-elfin Shea Ohmsford knows little of such troubles. Then the giant, forbidding Allanon reveals that the supposedly dead Warlock Lord is plotting to destroy everything in his wake. The sole weapon against this Power of Darkness is the Sword of Shannara, which can be used only by a true heir of Shannara. On Shea, last of the bloodline, rests the hope of all the races.&nbsp;</p> <p>Soon a Skull Bearer, dread minion of a mighty evil, flies into the Vale, seeking to destroy Shea. To save his home, Shea must flee, drawing the Skull Bearer after him in menacing pursuit.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thus begins the enthralling Shannara epic, a spellbinding tale of adventure, magic, and myth.&nbsp;</p>";
