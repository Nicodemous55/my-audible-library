window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 1972, Robert Silverberg, even then an acknowledged leader in the science fiction field, published a book that was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. More than three decades later, <i>Dying Inside</i> has stood the test of time and has been recognized as one of the finest novels the field has ever produced. Never wasting a word, Silverberg persuasively shows us what it would be like to read minds, painting an unforgettable portrait of a man shaped by that unique power; a power he is now inexorably losing.</p> <p>Acclaimed upon first publication by SF critics and mainstream reviewers alike, <i>Dying Inside</i> is overdue for reintroduction to todayâ€™s SF audience. This is a novel for everyone who appreciates deeply affecting characterization, imaginative power, and the irreplaceable perspective unique to speculative fiction of the highest order.</p>";
